# iPhone 6 Plus Rendering Test

Quick and dirty test apps to understand how the built-in downsampling to screen resolution on the iPhone 6 Plus works.

# Usage

There are iOS app projects: **PixelGridUIKit** (written in Swift) draws a test pattern using CoreGraphics in a normal `UIView`. **PixelGridOpenGL** (written in Objective-C) renders the same test pattern using OpenGL, skipping the scaling stage on the iPhone 6 Plus. Together, both apps illustrate the worst-case image degradation through the built-in scaling.

Note that if you run these apps on other devices than the iPhone 6 Plus or in the simulator, you wonâ€™t see any of the effects I mention in the blog post (with the possible exception of the iPhone 6 in Display Zoom mode).
